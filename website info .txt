I. This is my pricing template and my checklists for general vs deep cleanings that would be used and would like to get them in.
All the text in red under kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, living/dining/Family is all for General Cleaning. The blue is what comes with a Deep Cleaning.Then underneath that is the pricing aspect of it. I would absolutely like to have the pricing on the site.

Deep Cleans

Our Deep Cleans are a more intrusive and extensive cleaning than our maintenance cleans. While you still get the regular cleaning, our trained professionals tackle those hard to reach nooks and crannies that have collected years worth of debris and dirt.

In a recent report, the average person gets a deep cleaning every couple years. At Queen City Cleaning we recommended a minimum of twice of year. It helps keep your family safe by not breathing in years of accumulated dust, but rejuvenates your home to look almost as good as new.

Check out our Deep Cleaning Checklist below

Reoccurring Cleans

We know that every home is different from the next, so we offer weekly, bi-weekly and monthly cleans that include:

1. Dusting of pictures, furniture, and wall hangings

2. Disinfecting tub and toilet

3. Vacuuming and Steam Mopping Floors

4. Scrubbing kitchens

Our Reoccurring cleans, also known as maintenance cleans, are designed to make sure your home is clean on a regular basis. It not only helps prevent the build up of dust and dander, but being on a regular cleaning schedule helps to prevent the breakdown of certain surfaces over time (Chrome, stainless steel, tile, etc.). After your initial deep cleaning to bring the home up to par, maintaining your home is what our professionals do best. We treat your home like our own, guaranteeing satisfaction.
